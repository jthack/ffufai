ffufai is an AI-powered wrapper for the popular web fuzzer ffuf. It automatically suggests file extensions for fuzzing based on the target URL and its headers, using either OpenAI's GPT or Anthropic's Claude AI models.

## Features
<img width="600  " alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0384d4f0-3a07-48d9-9805-ea1e76b6b693">

- Seamlessly integrates with ffuf
- Automatically suggests relevant file extensions for fuzzing
- Supports both OpenAI and Anthropic AI models
- Passes through all ffuf parameters

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- ffuf (installed and accessible in your PATH)
- An OpenAI API key or Anthropic API key

## Installation

### Option 1: Local Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jthack/ffufai
   cd ffufai
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install requests openai anthropic
   ```

3. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x ffufai.py
   ```

4. (Optional) To use ffufai from anywhere, you can create a symbolic link in a directory that's in your PATH. For example:
   ```
   sudo ln -s /full/path/to/ffufai.py /usr/local/bin/ffufai
   ```
   Replace "/full/path/to/ffufai.py" with the actual full path to where you cloned the repository.

### Option 2: Docker Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jthack/ffufai
   cd ffufai
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t ffufai .
   ```

3. Run the container (choose one of these methods):

   **Method 1: Pass API keys directly** (quick but less secure):
   ```bash
   docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-yourkeyhere..." ffufai -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist
   # OR
   docker run -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-yourkeyhere..." ffufai -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist
   ```

   **Method 2: Use environment variables** (recommended):
   ```bash
   # First, export your API keys
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-yourkeyhere..."
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-yourkeyhere..."

   # Then run the container using those environment variables
   docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY="${OPENAI_API_KEY}" ffufai -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist
   ```

   **Method 3: Use an environment file** (most secure):
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file with your keys
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-yourkeyhere..." > .env
   echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-yourkeyhere..." >> .env

   # Run the container with the env file
   docker run --env-file .env ffufai -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist
   ```

   **Using wordlists with Docker:**
   To use local wordlists, you'll need to mount them into the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -v $(pwd)/wordlists:/wordlists \
     -e OPENAI_API_KEY="${OPENAI_API_KEY}" \
     ffufai -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /wordlists/wordlist.txt
   ```

Note: Replace `sk-yourkeyhere...` and `sk-ant-yourkeyhere...` with your actual API keys.

### API Key Setup

Set up your API key as an environment variable:

For OpenAI:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```
Or for Anthropic:
```
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

You can add these lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file to make them permanent.

If using Docker, you'll need to pass these environment variables when running the container as shown in the Docker installation steps above.

## Usage

Use ffufai just like you would use ffuf, but replace `ffuf` with `python3 ffufai.py` (or just `ffufai` if you've created the symbolic link):

```
python3 ffufai.py -u https://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

Or if you've created the symbolic link:

```
ffufai -u https://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

ffufai will automatically suggest extensions based on the URL and add them to the ffuf command.

## Parameters

ffufai accepts all the parameters that ffuf does, plus a few additional ones:

- `--ffuf-path`: Specifies the path to the ffuf executable. Default is 'ffuf'.
  Example: `ffufai --ffuf-path /usr/local/bin/ffuf -u https://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt`

- `--max-extensions`: Sets the maximum number of extensions to suggest. Default is 4.
  Example: `ffufai --max-extensions 6 -u https://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt`

- `-u`: Specifies the target URL. This parameter is required and should include the FUZZ keyword.
  Example: `ffufai -u https://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt`

- `-w`: Specifies the wordlist to use for fuzzing. This is a standard ffuf parameter.
  Example: `ffufai -u https://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt`

All other ffuf parameters can be used as normal. For a full list of ffuf parameters, refer to the ffuf documentation.

## Notes

- ffufai requires the FUZZ keyword to be at the end of the URL path for accurate extension suggestion. It will warn you if this is not the case.
- All ffuf parameters are passed through to ffuf, so you can use any ffuf option with ffufai.
- If both OpenAI and Anthropic API keys are set, ffufai will prefer the OpenAI key.

HUGE Shoutout to zlz, aka Sam Curry, for the amazing idea to make this project. He suggested it and 2 hours later, here it is :)

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter a "command not found" error, make sure you're using `python3 ffufai.py` or that you've correctly set up the symbolic link.
- If you get an API key error, ensure you've correctly set up your OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable.
- If you see "import: command not found" errors, it means the script is being interpreted by the shell instead of Python. Make sure you're running it with `python3 ffufai.py` or that the shebang line at the top of the script is correct.
